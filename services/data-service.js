It allows the caster to summon a modest quantity (one cubic foot) of the chosen element. The summoned matter appears (usually in a rough ball shape) in any open space within the spell\'s range. This cannot place the summoned material inside another physical object or living creature. The summoned element will behave in a normal and mundane matter; earth falls to the ground, water soaks anything it lands on, air blows away, and fire winks out unless there is something present for it to burn. In general it is impossible to use this spell effectively in combat, although clever shugenja may find a few modest combat uses. such as using Summon [Fire] to ignite a foe soaked in cooking oil. More commonly, the Spell\'s value is in simpler functions. such as summoning Water while in a desert, or summoning Fire to light a campfire without flint and tinder. Raises may be used with this spell to summon a more specfic type of the appropriate element, such as wood or iron with Earth, or tea with Water. The GM should choose how many Raises (generally anywhere from 1 to 4) this requires. However, these Raises <strong>cannot</strong> be used to create rare or precious materials (such as gold) or spiritually powerful substances (such as jade or crystal). Pg 166 Core Book' },

It allows the caster to speak with one of the local elemental kami, asking it a few questions, which is will answer honestly to the best of it\'s ability. Typically this spell will invoke the most active and energetic spirit of the chosen element in the area of effect, if all of the local spirits are quiescent, the GM may require the caster to call 1 or 2 Raises to "wake up" a local spirit enough to answer questions. A Spirit reached with Commune will answer two questions. The caster may Raise to get more questions (one per Raise). The caster may also Raise for clarity, to get a more accurate and informative answer to the questions. (Kami are notorious for their inabiiity to fully comprehend human behavior, and asking questions without Raises for clarity can often result in confusing, enigmatic, or incomplete answers.) Spirits do not forget anything, so theoretically a shugenja can ask a spirit about something that happened decades ago, however, they also do not experience time in the same way as mortals, so trying to ask about something from long ago will usually require Raises in order to make the caster\'s wishes clear to the spirit. The nature of the information which spirits can impart varies by element. Air spirits tend to be playful and easily distracted, conveying information as emotions or as riddles and jokes. Since they are more interested in feelings than in facts, and enjoy playing games with those who speak with them, commuting with an Air spirit can sometimes be very frustrating. Earth spirits are straightforward and matter of fact, often blunt, but are also often rather uninterested in the behavior of mortals, have a poor understanding of human emotion, and tend to be overly focused on obscure details such as the color of a piece of clothing or the weight of a horse. Fire spirits are irritable and tempermental, and are often angry at being summoned unless they are propitiated with an offering of something to burn. 0n the other hand, if a shugenja can please them they tend to offer the clearest and most accurate information. Water spirits communicate their knowledge through soundless visual images. This can be very helpful to a shugenja trying to investigate a past incident, but since the spirits cannot convey scent, sound, or emotion, the information they provide can often be incomplete or misleading.

After the spell expires, the target lapses into a state of complete exhaustion. This lasts for exactly half the duration of the spell effect. During this time, the target cannot take any signiﬁcant physical action, and can only move about sluggishly. Travel is completely impossible. Pg 192 Core Book' },

For all intents and purposes, the target is reduced to the Down Wound Level in terms of his ability to take actions. Each round he must make a Stamina Roll (TN 5) to resist. If the target makes three total successes, he spends one additional round vomiting up seawater, and then is fully recovered. However, if the target suffers two consecutive failures, he has fallen unconscious and will die within 1 minute unless some form of magical or medical intervention is made. Although means of combating drowning are not well known in Rokugan, it is possible to save an individual incapacitated by this spell by making a successful Medicine / Intelligence roll at TN 50.

The ultimate actualization of the Summon spell, this spell summons a massive kami of pure water to serve you. It takes the form of a vaguely humanoid shape, roughly ten feet in height, with an outline that constantly shifts and changes due to its fluid construction. The kami may move up to 15\' x your Water per round, and saturates the ground in a 20\' radius around it, ensuring that all terrain in that area is at least Moderate Terrain (unless it was already Difficult). The manifest kami is treated as if it has all Physical Traits equal to your Water Ring, and attacks with a Jiujutsu Skill Rank equal to half your Water Rank. Damage from these attacks has a DR equal to your Water Ring. For purposes of taking damage, the spirit is considered to have Wounds as though it were a human with Earth equal to your Water Ring, but suffers no Wound penalties. It is Invulnerable (see the creature rules in the Book of Void for details of this ability). If it is successfully reduced to zero Wounds, it is dispelled. Pg 192 Core Book' },
